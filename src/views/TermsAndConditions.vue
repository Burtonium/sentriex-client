      5 Risks
    </h4>
    <h6>
      5.1 Virtual Currency Risks
    </h6>
    <p>
      Virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are open-source peer-to-peer payment networks and they are able to send money to each other without any central server. The network is secured by cryptography, that allows to use only the money belonging to the Client, and it prevents the reuse of spent money. Bitcoin cannot be influenced or counterfeit, nobody can manage the network. This system is anonymous, non-controllable and international. The final amount of Bitcoin is known in advance, the release of Bitcoins into circulation is defined in the source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virtual currency is not a official currency protected by national bank. The price of the virtual currency is influenced by a free global market, due to the changes in supply and demand, the price can be very volatile. The price can be influenced by the theft of the currency, hacker attacks, legislation in different countries etc. And other risks that are not mentioned in these Terms may occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virtual currency is suspectible to irrational movements and it may lead to the loss of confidence, which may cause the collapse of the currency. It means that the value of Client's investment can significantly increase or decrease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virtual currencies are not controlled by any authority and it is impossible to cancel any completed payment in this currency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the risks arising from the virtual currency trade, we reccomend that you carefully consider your financial situation and your ability to handle risks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Operator is not responsible for the exchange of the virtual currency between Clients. The risk is only on the Client's side. The Seller is responsible for the correct remittance and the Buyer is providing TRUE information. The Operator is an arbitrator who oversees the proper fulfillment of obligations and reserves the right to penalize Clients when they do not meet their commitments.
