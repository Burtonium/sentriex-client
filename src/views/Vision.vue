      Company Vision
    </h2>
    <p>
      To offer cryptocurrency investment funds and products to as many individuals
      as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Restrictive regulations and lack of clarity from regulators has left investors
      to fend for themselves in the cryptocurrency space. This leaves those
      interested with the monumental task of learning about the vast number of
      different cryptocurrencies, how to buy and sell them, how to secure them,
      and forces many to become traders. The best options available today are
      for investors to buy and hold themselves or invest into one of very limited
      number of index type products. The most recent bubble highlights the
      devastating inadequacy of these two options. Bitcoin has lost over 80%
      of its value from it’s peak, and many other coins 90-98%.

      The truth of the market is that it is played by professionals and is designed
      to destroy retail traders and the inexperienced. The vast majority of individuals
      should not be trading in this space themselves but feel strongly that crypto is
      going to grow significantly and don’t want to miss out. Our platform aims to
      give back control and confidence to investors by providing them with products
      and services to manage their crypto investments without being burdened by
      the stress of watching charts, reading articles and trying to trade and time
      the market.
